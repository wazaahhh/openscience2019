# Science on Github


*  Github is a popular website for collaborative work on software code, however it isn't limited to only coding, Github can be a huge help for various scientific domains. For example, in this article, Caitlin Rivers worked on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa with the help of Github. Instead of keeping the data to herself, she posted them to the site. This results in other researchers to began to download the date and contributed to the project, some created scripts to do error-checks.

*  With its 15 millions users, Github has a huge potential. It can greatly increase the speed of science projects. Even though there are others data sharing systems, Github is designed for transparent collaboration. Users can track and reverse every changes made to a project.

*  In my opinion, Github is a brillant platform for datasharing and datalogging. It encourages teamwork rather than working alone.
  Science today is open to anyone, and Github is a door for this new generation of "scientists".
